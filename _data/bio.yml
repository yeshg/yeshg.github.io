  content:  "I am a 3rd year undergraduate at <strong>Oregon State University</strong> majoring in Computer Science. I currently do research at the <a>Dynamic Robotics Lab</a> on using reinforcement learning for controlling humanoid robots. My research interests lie in the intersection of <strong>artificial intelligence</strong>, <strong>control theory</strong>, and <strong>legged robotics</strong>. I'm also interested in computer graphics/simulation and distributed computing. Most of my code is freely available on my github, <a href=\"http://github.com/yeshg\">@yeshg</a>.

  In my free time I practice guitar, play basketball, and draw digital art."
