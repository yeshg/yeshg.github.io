  content:  "I am a 2nd year undergraduate at <strong>Oregon State University</strong> majoring in Computer Science. I currently do research at the <a>Dynamic Robotics Lab</a> on developing reinforcement learning algorithms to control bipedal robots. My research interests lie in the intersection of <strong>deep reinforcement learning</strong> and other <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> techniques with <strong>humanoid robotics</strong> and <strong>control theory</strong>. I'm also interested in software defined networking, virtual reality, and distributed computing. Most of my code is freely available on my github, <a href=\"http://github.com/yeshg\">@yeshg</a>. 
  <br><br>
  In my free time I play basketball, do gymnastics, make music playlists, and draw."
